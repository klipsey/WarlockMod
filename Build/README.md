# Skills

## Passive: **Torment**

- Interrogator can hit and be hit by both allies and enemies. Attackers that have hit Interrogator are permanently marked as Guilty. Hitting Guilty targets grants attack speed and damage until they die (Once per target).

## Special: **Convict**

- Target a Guilty enemy and fight them for 10 seconds. Your primary can no longer hit you but can continuously stack Guilty's buff. During Convict all external damage is negated including your own.
